What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it lets git know to start tracking the version
changes in the file. You need to do it since you need to intentionally tell git
when you need it to start working on a project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to prep exactly files you want to commit before you
have to commmit them. It gives you some added customization and flexibility so
that you have everything paired up exactly how you like it.
